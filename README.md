# 🔐 OWASP Top 10 Notes

This section is dedicated to documenting and understanding the **OWASP Top 10** web application vulnerabilities.

## 📌 Purpose

I'm using this space to write detailed notes on each of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.  
Each vulnerability will have:

- 🧠 A brief explanation  
- 💥 Real-world examples  
- 🛠️ How to test for it  
- 🛡️ How to prevent or fix it  
- ✍️ My personal notes or observations

## 🧱 Structure

Each vulnerability will have its own dedicated file:

1. **[A01 - Broken Access Control](./A01_Broken_Access_Control.md)**
2. **[A02 - Cryptographic Failures](./A02_Cryptographic_Failures.md)**
3. **[A03 - Injection (SQLi, etc.)](./A03_Injection.md)**
4. **[A04 - Insecure Design](./A04_Insecure_Design.md)**
5. **[A05 - Security Misconfiguration](./A05_Security_Misconfiguration.md)**
6. **[A06 - Vulnerable & Outdated Components](./A06_Outdated_Components.md)**
7. **[A07 - Identification and Authentication Failures](./A07_Auth_Failures.md)**
8. **[A08 - Software and Data Integrity Failures](./A08_Integrity_Failures.md)**
9. **[A09 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures](./A09_Logging_Monitoring.md)**
10. **[A10 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./A10_SSRF.md)**

## 🧠 Why This?

I'm passionate about security and I believe understanding the OWASP Top 10 is fundamental to building secure apps and becoming a solid **Red Teamer**.

> This is an ongoing study log. I’ll be updating it as I go deeper into each vulnerability.
